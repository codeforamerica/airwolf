Code for an application helper
==============================

Developed by Team SF for San Francisco HSA.

# Introduction

This is an application helper - that is, it is a guide through the the process of applying for social service programs. The process can be long, complex, and frustrating; that's where the application helper comes in.

## Who are you?
We're Team SF: [Jake](https://github.com/lippytak), [Rebecca](https://github.com/rcackerman), [Andy](https://github.com/andyhull), and [Marc](https://github.com/MarcCfA).

## What's next?

This is the MVP, so all we've got right now is a series of static pages. We're planning to build this out

# See Application Helper in Action

We're at [codeforamerica.github.com/airwolf/index.html](http://codeforamerica.github.com/airwolf/index.html) for now.

# Deploy for Yourself

Okay, so this is kind of awkward... there's nothing to deploy at this point. Come back later for more info, though.
